## Tips

### Use Springless Triggers With Smash Ultimate
---

Smash Ultimate ignores digital trigger press. Analog trigger value of ≥ 79 is required to activate shield. To achieve this on triggers with springs removed:
1. Switch trigger mode to 5 or 6 (AB+L or AB+R)
2. If using SmashScope - adjust (increase) the value until analog value is ≥ 79; if connected to Switch, adjust (increase) the value until pressing the trigger results in Shield (LB+Du/Dd or RB+Du/Dd). 

### Adjusting Analog Diagonals Values
---

By default diagonals are set to `x = ±7000`, `y = ±7000`. These should be versatile for most use cases. However, it's worth trying other values to see if they feel better or are more suitable for your playstyle.

> **Note**
> These may be out-of-date | historical | etc etc. Values presented below were mentioned by the corresponding user in PhobGCC discord as their preferred values at the time. This obviously might have changed.

**Rienne's Standard Analog Diagonals Values**
---

* North (top\|high) corners: set `y = 7250`
* South (bottom\|low) corners: set `y = 6750`

Some references [^1] and [^2].

**CarVac's Preference (Falcon)**
---

* South (bottom\|low) cotrol stick diagonals with `y ≤ 7000` (jab cancel values). 
* This allows to jab, return to crouch, jab by holding down and back (as an example).

Some references [^3] and [^4].

**Frost's Preference (Ice Climbers)**
---

* South (bottom\|low) corners - set `y = 6875`

References: [^5]

**Other Useful Ranges**
---

Hax$ has shared the following useful ranges for `y`:

|Axis|From|To|Utility|
|----|----|--|-------|
|y|-6125|-6500|down-angled ftilt|
|y|-6250|-6875|crouch walk option select|
|y|-6625|-6875|vanilla shield drop|
|y|-7000|-7500|jab cancel (down+back while jabbing will immediately interrupt the jab combo with a crouch that you can jab 1 out of)|

### SmashScope

* **Download Link**: [https://goomwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SmashScope.zip](https://goomwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SmashScope.zip)
* **Video Guide**: [https://youtu.be/XzgS1aDb7TQ](https://youtu.be/XzgS1aDb7TQ)

#### SmashScope on Dolphin

1. Do not use the Slippi Dolphin build, instead download mainline Dolphin at [https://dolphin-emu.org/download/](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/) (Windows/MacOS). On Linux - either use your distribution's pre-built package or [build it yourself](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Building_Dolphin_on_Linux).
2. If using a Mayflash, OEM or any other 2/4 port GCC adapter - use Port 1. In Dolphin controller settings, disable all Wiimotes.

### Install Slippi and Overclock Adapter on Arch Linux or Arch-based distros

Here's a [guide I wrote for myself](https://gist.github.com/SirToffski/be41fa9a7e2a2629fad811da80f1a685) to use as a reference (it's easy to forget all the steps). It should be up-to-date and revelant as of April 12, 2023.
